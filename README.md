Fonts of R logos that we love ❤️

# Introduction
Sometimes I feel there is a need to use a font-awesome style icon to mark our favorite R logos. So I spent sometime and converted those logos into fonts! These fonts are made by [icomoon](https://icomoon.io/) and you can just them just like the way you use font-awesome. :)
